# Home assignment part II

Hi! 
This repo contains a simple HTML interface and my attempt at the SQL task. I'm still early in my SQL journey, so this was both a challenge and a learning opportunity for me.

### 🧠 What’s inside

- `index.html`:

This file is a super simple mock-up of an Ad Review interface. It's built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- `query.sql`:

I tackled 2 out of 3 SQL questions, with comments for clarity. I got some help from an LLM (just being honest) and tested everything using [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/). I’m learning as I go and currently working through a free SQL course to build my skills.
